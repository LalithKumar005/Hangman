"PROBLEM DESCRIPTION"
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. A correct guess of a letter fills up the faces where they are present in the word, whereas a wrong guess leads to addition of a body part to the gallows(head, body, left arm, right arm, right leg, left leg). The player will continue guessing until they can either figure out what the correct word is or all the six body parts are in the gallow. At any point, the player can guess and enter the entire word, and if the word turns out to be right, the player wins and the game ends immediately, whereas if the word is wrong, a body part is added to the gallows and the player is prompted to try again.
